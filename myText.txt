I always start my workshops and webinars by asking the
attendees these 2 questions:
1. Why are you not able to become successful?
2. Why are you not able to become rich and wealthy?
When I ask the attendees to share their answers, they get
surprised when they find that I have already written most of their
answers on a piece of paper.
I am able to do so because I receive similar answers in all
my workshops. The attendees may change, the geography may
change, the age group may change, the educational backgrounds
and profession may change but the answers to these questions
remain the same.
This means that the problems that people face in becoming
rich and successful are somewhat similar. Do you want to know
the top 10 reasons that people give for not able to live a rich and
successful life?
Before I tell you the reasons, I want you to think about the top
2 reasons for yourself, why you aren’t able to get the desired level
of success and wealth in your life. Come on, it’s not that difficult.
You are reading this book because you desire more success, right?
Then come up with the top 2 reasons that are stopping you.
Whenever people do this exercise, they get into a state which
I call the state of learning and transformation. Most of us do not
experience this zone because we are too occupied with the noises
of the external world. But this exercise gives you a chance to get
disconnected from the external noises for 60 seconds and listen
to your inner voice.
So let’s begin! Take a pause for 90 seconds, close your eyes
and introspect. After you have the answers, write them down in a
brief manner in the space below.
